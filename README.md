Data Science Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This public repo has been created to be able to let peers review the code I wrote for the Data Science course "Getting and Cleaning Data" (part of R Programming as well).
The instructor proposed the data set called 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones' (which can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Extra information
In the run_analysis_R I tried to play around a little bit with working directory variables as well. So that a following user using different data sets and a different working directory would quite easily be able to change the variables and get the script working. If you have any improvements for that part in particular, I'd love to know, even though it is not parth of the project!

## Instructions
Running run_analysis.R will get the required result. This result is displayed in the txt file named "independent_tidy_data_set.txt" (Yes, I know, original name ;-)). 
The codebook can be used to find a description of the various variables.
